msgid ""
"The VCS repository you want to use has to be accessible to Weblate. With "
"a publicly available repository you just need to enter correct URL (for "
"example ``git://github.com/WeblateOrg/weblate.git`` or "
"``https://github.com/WeblateOrg/weblate.git``), but for private "
"repositories the setup might be more complex."

msgid "Weblate internal URLs"
msgstr ""

#: ../../vcs.rst:25
msgid ""
"To share one repository between different components you can use a "
"special URL like ``weblate://project/component``. This way, the component"
" will share the VCS repository configuration with referenced component "
"and the VCS repository will be stored just once on the disk."

msgid "SSH repositories"
msgstr ""

#: ../../vcs.rst:33
msgid ""
"The most frequently used method to access private repositories is based "
"on SSH. To have access to such a repository, you generate SSH key for "
"Weblate and authorize it to access the repository. Weblate also needs to "
"know the host key to avoid man in the middle attacks. This all can be "
"done in the Weblate administration interface:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Generating SSH keys"
msgstr ""

#: ../../vcs.rst:44
msgid ""
"You can generate or display the key currently used by Weblate in the "
"admin interface (follow :guilabel:`SSH keys` link on main admin page). "
"Once you've done this, Weblate should be able to access your repository."
msgstr ""

#: ../../vcs.rst:50

"The keys need to be without password to make it work, so be sure they are"
" well protected against malicious usage."

msgstr ""

#: ../../vcs.rst:61
msgid ""
"Before connecting to the repository, you also need to verify SSH host "
"keys of servers you are going to access in the same section of the admin "
"interface. You can do this in the :guilabel:`Add host key` section. Just "
"enter hostname you are going to access (eg. ``gitlab.com``) and press "
":guilabel:`Submit`. After adding it please verify that the fingerprint "
"matches the server you're adding, the fingerprints will be displayed in "
"the confirmation message:"

"To access protected HTTPS repositories, you need to include the username "
"and password in the URL. Don't worry, Weblate will strip this information"
" when showing the URL to the users (if they are allowed to see the "
"repository URL at all)."
msgstr ""

"If you need to access http/https VCS repositories using a proxy server, "

msgstr ""

#: ../../vcs.rst:93
msgid ""
"This can be configured using the ``http_proxy``, ``https_proxy``, and "
"``all_proxy`` environment variables (check cURL documentation for more "
"details) or by enforcing it in VCS configuration, for example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../vcs.rst:103
msgid ""
"The proxy setting needs to be done in the same context which is used to "
"execute Weblate. For the environment it should be set for both server and"
" cron jobs. The VCS configuration has to be set for the user which is "
"running Weblate."
